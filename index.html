          <div class="section5"><p>The first video game was made in 1958 by a physicist, and was a simple tennis game. Now as technological advancements have evolved and improved, it has paved the way for more complex games to be released, moving from the 2D style of old video games and into 3D graphics.
              As time goes on improvements continue to be made to gaming, such as the devices used changing, from old slow computers to a headset that allows people to play a video game as if they were inside it. <br><!--This creates a gap in the text to help with readability-->
          The gaming industry as a business has also grown at an exponential rate, with the industry growing to around 138 billion dollars revenue since the first game was released. Some doctors are now even proscribing video games as a way to help hand eye coordination stress relief, problem solving skills and also helping to alleviate other various ailments like PTSD.
</p></div>  
          <div class="section6"><p>I made this website so that I could teach and inform people about the history of video games and for an assessment In the digital subject for year 12. The aim was for people who don't yet know about video games very much to learn about things such as the first video game(click the button in the top right under first video games to learn about this), and more things like what the industry is like now and the advancements in the gaming field with new consoles and games etc. <br>There are multiple pages in this website for things which you can go through with the buttons in top left. My plan was for everyone to be able to access it no matter what region or how bad their wifi is which I did by making the website as small as I could and keeping the images small. So that you can use the website easily I have used simple language as I can. <br>If you would like to contact me further email me at Joseph.sherring@student.hhs.school.nz or call me at 027 576 2779. </p></div>

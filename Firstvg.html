                   <div class="section5"><p>The first recognized example of a video game was unveiled by Dr. Edward Uhler Condon in 1940. The game, based on the ancient mathematical game of Nim, was played by about 50,000 people during the six months it was on display, with the computer winning most of the games.
However, the first game console was designed for commercial home use did not emerge until 30 years later, when Ralph Baer and his team released his prototype, the “Brown Box,” in 1967.
The “Brown Box” was a vacuum tube-circuit that could be connected to a television set and allowed two users to control cubes that chased each other on the screen. The “Brown Box” could be programmed to play a variety of games, including ping pong, checkers and four sports games. Using advanced technology for this time, added accessories included a lightgun for a target shooting game, and a special attachment used for a golf putting game. 
This is where the gaming industry started and it has only expanded from that original 50,000 people that played Dr Edwards game.

          <div class="section4"><h2>New Advancements</h2></div>
          <div class="section5"><p>The Video game industry has ballooned to an incredible size over the past 10 years, with popularity increasing at an amazing rate, and video games overtaking the movie industry and the music industry respectively. This really shows how big of a business is around the world and how much of a big deal it is with entertainment for us to consume. The industry is valued at around 180 billion US dollars, compared to the movie industry which is a bit over 100 billion dollars which helps to put its popularity into perspective. The estimated amount of people who play video games is around 2.7 billion people which is around about 35% of the entire world population.</p></div>
          <div class="section6"><p>I made this website so that I could teach and inform people about the history of video games and for an assessment In the digital subject for year 12. The aim was for people who don't yet know about video games very much to learn about things such as the first video game(click the button in the top right under first video games to learn about this), and more things like what the industry is like now and the advancements in the gaming field with new consoles and games etc. <br>There are multiple pages in this website for things which you can go through with the buttons in top left. My plan was for everyone to be able to access it no matter what region or how bad their wifi is which I did by making the website as small as I could and keeping the images small. So that you can use the website easily I have used simple language as I can</p></div>
